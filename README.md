# IntelliBoard Block

Designed as a Moodle block, the IntelliBoard Block provides immediate course and/or activity data to a Moodle user.  Depending on preferred configuration, Moodle users can see course and activity completion, visits, time spent, grades and more.

The IntelliBoard block also provides the role-appropriate IntelliBoard links (i.e. Learner Dashboard, Instructor Dashboard, IntelliBoard.net).

Prior to installing the IntelliBoard Block, please install the IntelliBoard plugin.  For more information, visit [support page][support]
